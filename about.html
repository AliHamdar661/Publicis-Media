        gold medal of the best manager in Lebanon. While he is always focusing on achieving the team's goals,
        he is also concerned about a great work environment where everything flows smoothly without extra pressure
        on our team members, that's the man's first and most important skill, to keep everything well suited for the best 
        performance that could be attained. (P.s. You're the luckiest if you can catch him available on Microsoft Teams)
